				Hi... My name is Damir, and I am a Woodwork & Art enthusiast. It means that I like working with my hands and tools to produce authentic handmade products that you can see in my <a href="gallery.php">gallery</a>. I started working with wood as a child. I like walks in nature, where I always find some pieces of wood or stone, sometimes even whole palm leaves that I drag home with me. Here on my site, you can find some beautiful photography transfers on wood or stone, small boxes created from wood or aluminum... You can also find handcrafted clocks and lamps created from pieces of wood found during my walks. You can find a little bit of everything, actually.

				Techniques that I use I learned and picked up from various sources. Some of them I've changed, and some remained the same. For motives I mostly like to use nature and solitude, like those of fisherman in the mist, ships on open ocean, or motives of wood, plains and other. Well, my house is now full of things that I present on this web page, so if anybody is interested in purchasing a product, or contacting me to give me advice, or listen to one of mine, or just to share an experience, You are free to <a href="contact.php">contact me</a>. Until then, hope you'll enjoy the <a href="gallery.php">gallery</a>!
